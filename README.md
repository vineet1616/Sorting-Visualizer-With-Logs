# Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

How Bubble Sort Works?

Consider an array arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8}

First Pass: 

Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater.
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1. 
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4 
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
Second Pass: 

Now, during second iteration it should look like this:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
Third Pass: 

Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed.
The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 

CODE in C++

// C++ program for implementation of Bubble sort
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A function to implement bubble sort
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i, j;
	for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)

		// Last i elements are already
		// in place
		for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
			if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
				swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
}

// Function to print an array
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	cout << endl;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 5, 1, 4, 2, 8};
	int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	bubbleSort(arr, N);
	cout << "Sorted array: \n";
	printArray(arr, N);
	return 0;
}

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N^2) worst case
