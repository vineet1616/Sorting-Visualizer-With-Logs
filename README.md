# Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

How Bubble Sort Works?

Consider an array arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8}

First Pass: 

Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater.
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1. 
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4 
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
Second Pass: 

Now, during second iteration it should look like this:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
Third Pass: 

Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed.
The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 

CODE in C++

```
// C++ program for implementation of Bubble sort
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A function to implement bubble sort
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i, j;
	for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)

		// Last i elements are already
		// in place
		for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
			if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
				swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
}

// Function to print an array
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	cout << endl;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 5, 1, 4, 2, 8};
	int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	bubbleSort(arr, N);
	cout << "Sorted array: \n";
	printArray(arr, N);
	return 0;
}
```
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N^2) worst case

# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Characteristics of Insertion Sort:
->This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation
->Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
->Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

Working of Insertion Sort algorithm:

Consider an example: arr[]: {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}

First Pass:

Initially, the first two elements of the array are compared in insertion sort.
   12   	   11   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Here, 12 is greater than 11 hence they are not in the ascending order and 12 is not at its correct position. Thus, swap 11 and 12.
So, for now 11 is stored in a sorted sub-array.
   11   	   12   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Second Pass:

 Now, move to the next two elements and compare them
   11   	   12   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Here, 13 is greater than 12, thus both elements seems to be in ascending order, hence, no swapping will occur. 12 also stored in a sorted sub-array along with 11
Third Pass:

Now, two elements are present in the sorted sub-array which are 11 and 12
Moving forward to the next two elements which are 13 and 5
   11   	   12   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Both 5 and 13 are not present at their correct place so swap them
   11   	   12   	   5   	   13   	   6   
After swapping, elements 12 and 5 are not sorted, thus swap again
   11   	   5   	   12   	   13   	   6   
Here, again 11 and 5 are not sorted, hence swap again
   5   	   11   	   12   	   13   	   6   
here, it is at its correct position
Fourth Pass:

Now, the elements which are present in the sorted sub-array are 5, 11 and 12
Moving to the next two elements 13 and 6
   5   	   11   	   12   	   13   	   6   
Clearly, they are not sorted, thus perform swap between both
   5   	   11   	   12   	   6   	   13   
Now, 6 is smaller than 12, hence, swap again
   5   	   11   	   6   	   12   	   13   
Here, also swapping makes 11 and 6 unsorted hence, swap again
   5   	   6   	   11   	   12   	   13   
Finally, the array is completely sorted.

CODE in C++
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to sort an array using
// insertion sort
void insertionSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i, key, j;
	for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
	{
		key = arr[i];
		j = i - 1;

		// Move elements of arr[0..i-1],
		// that are greater than key, to one
		// position ahead of their
		// current position
		while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)
		{
			arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
			j = j - 1;
		}
		arr[j + 1] = key;
	}
}

// A utility function to print an array
// of size n
void printArray(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	cout << endl;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 12, 11, 13, 5, 6 };
	int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

	insertionSort(arr, N);
	printArray(arr, N);

	return 0;
}
```

Time Complexity: O(N^2) in worst case
